# Machine Exercise 6

## [ME06_1](me06_1.c)
Number Sorter (2.5 pts)

Inputs:

1. Five integers (-,0,+)

Outputs:

1. Five integers (user input)
2. Five integers from least to greatest

Prompt the user to input five integers. Store these integers in an array and print them from least to greatest. Always assume that the user will input integers only.

## [ME06_2](me06_2.c)
Calculator Functions (2.5 pts)

Inputs:

1. Number array A (5 integers (-,0,+))
2. Number array B (5 integers (-,0,+))

Outputs:

1. Number array A and Number array B (user input)
2. Sum (A + B)
3. Difference (A – B)
4. Product (A * B)
5. Quotient (A / B)
6. Modulo (A % B)

Prompt the user to input two arrays of five integers each. Display both array of integers(user input) and compute its sum, difference, product, quotient, and modulo using FUNCTIONS. Always assume that the user will input integers only. Name your functions as sum(), difference(), product(), quotient(), and modulo(), respectively. These functions should only compute and return their corresponding array outputs. All “printf” commands should be on the “int main()” function.

## [ME06_3](me06_3.c)
Frequency Checker (2.5 pts)

Inputs:

1. A string (up to 50 characters)
2. A character

Outputs:

1. A string (user input)
2. A character (user input)
3. Frequency of the character in the string

Prompt the user to input a string then prompt the user to input a character. Store this string and display how many times the character was detected. The user could input any character valid (e.g. alphanumeric, symbols, etc).

## [ME06_4](me06_4.c)
Palindrome (2.5 pts)

Inputs:

1. A string (up to 20 characters)

Outputs:

1. A string (user input)
2. Palindrome or not

Prompt the user to input a string. Store this string and identify if this string is a palindrome or not. A Palindrome is a word that is spelled the same backwards (e.g. racecar). Always assume that the user will input alphabetical characters only. You could use string.h library functions (e.g. strncpy(), strncmp(), strncat(), strlen(), toupper(), tolower()).

Hint: your code should also detect capitalization (e.g. Racecar is a palindrome!).
