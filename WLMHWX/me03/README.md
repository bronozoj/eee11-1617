#[ME03_1](me03_1.c)
Factorial Computer (2 pts)

Inputs:1) An integer (from 1-12)
	Outputs: 1) An integer (user input)
			2) Factorial Output
Prompt the user to input an integer. Display the integer (user input) and compute its factorial output using a WHILE 
loop. Always assume the input is valid (input is an integer and not a character, float, etc). Do an error check (identify this 
number if it is between 1 and 12, if it is not, end the program).

ME03_2) Sum and Average (2 pts)
	Inputs: 1) An integer (positive)
	Outputs: 1) Iteration number
			2) Sum of all inputs
			3) Average of all inputs
Using a DO-WHILE loop, prompt the user to input an integer and compute the sum and average of all the user inputs. The input should be asked one-by-one and the sum and average should be computed every after input of user. Display the iteration number, sum, and average of the inputs of the user. Always assume the input is valid (input is an integer and not a character, float, etc). End the program if the user input a negative number.

ME03_3) Prime Number Detector (2 pts)
	Inputs: 1) An integer (from 1 to 1000)
	Outputs: 1) An integer (user input)
			2) Prime number or Not
Prompt the user to input an integer from 1 to 1000. Check if it is a prime number using a FOR statement. Display the user input and if the number is prime or not. Always assume the input is valid (input is an integer and not a character, float, etc). Do an error check (identify this number if it is between 1 and 1000, if it is not, end the program).

ME03_4) Multiplication Table (2 pts)
	Inputs: 1) Number of rows (from 1-10)
			2) Number of columns (from 1-10)
	Outputs: 1) Multiplication table with corresponding rows and columns
Prompt the user to input an integer from 1 to 10. Do a multiplication table using a NESTED FOR statement. Display the complete multiplication table with proper rows and columns. Always assume the input is valid (input is an integer and not a character, float, etc). Do an error check (identify this number if it is between 1 and 10, if it is not, end the program).

ME03_5) Age Group (2 pts)
	Inputs: 1) Age (positive number)
	Outputs: 1) Applicable Age Group
Prompt the user to input an integer. Display ALL applicable age group according to the figure shown using a NESTED IF statement. Make sure to include BOTH primary and secondary age group in your output. Always assume the input is valid (input is an integer and not a character, float, etc). Do an error check (identify this number if it is positive, if it is not, end the program).
